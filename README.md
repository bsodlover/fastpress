# fastpress
Fastpress is a speed focused php content media manager. Instead of saving the article's text in a DB, it is stored in an HTML file, but, (currently), it can't be edited.  It is very useful for making small posts with images, for example, an art gallery.
# Warning
Feel free to try this software, but beaware, its a beta, and it has some security flaws I will try to improve over time.
# How to install
